# lander
This a lunar lander type game in Python.   I run it with Python3.8 but it should run in any Python3 environment.  
The bitmap files need to go in a folder called 'images' within the main folder.   
The game is run with the 'rocket_game.py' file.

Points are awarded for a successful landing and extra bonus points for the fuel remaining.   
After a landing the level increases which gives the new screen starting with the lander at an increased speed and angle.
Eventually, the lander will shoot off the top of the screen and you need to use skill and the velocity and angle instruments to get back on screen.

This is an early Python project for me so I've probably done some stuff the hard way and there may well be some redundant code in there.
The backing track was recorded using Audacity and my guitar!
